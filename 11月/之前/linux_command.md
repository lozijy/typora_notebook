the directory structure for linux distruibution

# Where does apt-get install packages to?

FHS is not considered to be some authority on directory structure and  contents for absolutely every Linux distribution, but it is generally  the most common standard of file layout. All directories and files in  FHS appear under ‘/’ – the root directory. Let’s take a look at some  commonly used directories.

- /bin directory holds the primary command binaries.
- /dev directory contains device files.
- /etc directory has host-specific configuration files.
- /home folder contains the user’s personal settings and saved files.
