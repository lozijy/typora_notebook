zephyr 温柔的和风 灵风来自希腊神话

there was silence now except for the  distant sea, a slight zephyr stirring the trees

Notus南风

Eurus东风

Zephyrus西风 Kind and gentle



From Taliyah,the stoneweaver

know the loom,be the stone命数如织，当为磐石

loom 织布机，若隐若现的情景,联想到希腊神话中的命运三女神，如织绸一般错综复杂的命运

the loom of fate

The die is cast 木已成舟

Every tapestry begins with a single stitch 每一幅挂毯都始于一针一线(千里之行始于足下)

even the smallest stone can start an avalanche再小的石头也能印发雪崩

Hard work polishes the roughest stones

keep your eyes on the horizon and your feet on the ground脚踏实地，仰望远方

the world is a tapestry of our own making
